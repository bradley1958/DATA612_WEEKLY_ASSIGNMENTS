SUMMARY:

We have used the ".astype" syntax in Pandas to convert various columns from one Dtype to another.
In this case from a non-categorical Dtype to a categorical Dtype (Action Item 1).

Next we used the ".astype" syntax to convert a different Column Dtype to a String (Action Item 2).
In my example I converted a Dtype of "bool" to Dtype "object, 
and then converted it back to it's original Dtype of "bool" using the ".astype" syntax.

From our lecture notes we have seen that Dtypes govern which operations can and cannot be performed on a given column.
The ability to convert a Column type gives the analyst another tool so that the dataset can be prepared and cleaned for further data modeling/exploration and algorithm use.
