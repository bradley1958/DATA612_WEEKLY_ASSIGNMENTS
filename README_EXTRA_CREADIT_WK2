The Extra Credit Challenge was to download the Vaccine data on the DTP3 Immunization dataset.
Next, we were to write a short Jupyter Notebook on the exploring the dataset.
First, I loaded the datset and looked at the data. Taking note of the many NaN (null values) throughout the dataset.
Next, I used a basic ".info()" syntax to look at the dataset, and then followed up with looking at the Column Headings
by using the "print(df.columns)" syntax.
I followed up by looking at only the UK and US rows by using the "iloc" syntax - df.iloc[183:185]
Next, I created a basic bar chart to compare the three year period 1980 to 1982 between the UK and the US
This chart showed how the UK lagged behind the US in the number of DIP3 Immunizations for that period (1980 - 1982)
